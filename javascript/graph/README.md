# Graphs
non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them
## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
1. add vertex
2. addEdge
3. getVertices
4. getNeighbors
5. size

## Approach & Efficiency
1. add vertex :  worst time and space O(1)
2. addEdge : worst time O(n) , space O(1)
3. getVertices : worst time O(n) , space O(n)
4. getNeighbors : worst time O(n) , space O(1)
5. size : worst time O(n) , space O(1)
