# Singly Linked List
Linked list for insert data and delete data faster than array
but for search linked list slow than array
## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node
- Create Linked List class
- Create insert function to insert data in node in linked list
- Create include function to search about data in linked list
- Create toString function to return string


## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach

-if statment to check data
-While loop to loop through data

### Efficiency

Big o -> O(1) for all functions


## API

insert -> to insert data into node in linked list

include -> search about data into linked list
