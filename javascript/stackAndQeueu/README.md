# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
it is data structure to store data the system of stack is last in first out.
## Queue
it is data structure to store data the system of stack is first in last out.

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated

  Create methods for stack :
  - push : adds a new node with that value to the **top** of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
  - pop : Removes the node from the top of the stack
  - peek : Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
  - is empty : Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
  Create methods for queue :
  - enqueue : adds a new node with that value to the **back** of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
  - dequeue : Removes the node from the front of the queue.
  - peek : Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
  - is empty : Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach
just use if statment to check of conditions

### Efficiency
**Stack&Queue:** Big O is O(1) becuse we did not use any loop (linear).
