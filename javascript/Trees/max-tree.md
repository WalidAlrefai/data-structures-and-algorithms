## Whiteboard Process
![](./max-tree.png)
## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach
1. use inOrder method from binary tree to store data in array
2. use for loop to loop through array
3. use if statment to check conditions

### Efficiency
- isEmpty --> Big O is O(1) becuse is linear
- findMax --> Big O is O(n) becuse we loor through out of array


## Solution
npm test binary.test.js
