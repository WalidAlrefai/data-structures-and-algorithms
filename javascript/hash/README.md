# Hashtables
Hash tables allow the storage and retrieval of data in an average time of O(1). At its most basic level, a hash table data structure is just an array. Data is stored into this array at specific indices designated by a hash function. A hash function is a mapping between the set of input data and a set of integers.

## Challenge
Create HashTable Class in this Class create methods work with HashTable (hash , set , get , keys , contains)
## Approach & Efficiency
### Approach
- reduce
- for loop
- while loop
- forEach
- if statment
### Efficiency
 time : O(1)
The hash key is calculated in O(1) time complexity as always, and the required location is accessed in O(1).
Insertion: In the best case, the key indicates a vacant location and the element is directly inserted into the hash table.
 space : O(n) where n is the number of entries
